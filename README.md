# my_tasks
These are the codes of the projects I have done for the internships.

For Task 1: 
I have created a temperature convertor using basic HTML,CSS and JavaScript that converts Celcius to Fahrenheit and Kelvin. 
It can also do vice versa i.e. convert Fahrenheit to Celcius and Kelvin. The same thing goes for Kelvin too.

For Task 2:
I have created a simple website having a homepage similar to that of Netflix using HTML and CSS.
